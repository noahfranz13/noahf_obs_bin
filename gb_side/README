This directory contains scripts that run in the Green Bank environment, typically on fourier.

Some of the scripts are run as a cron job (currently on fourier) once a day:

cron_get_go : 
  master cron job

get_go : 
  main script that scrapes recent info from the archival GO fits files
  and puts them into a log - this script uses bl_open_fits.py to scrape
  out pointing info from Antenna fits files (requires python37 venv)

bl_open_fits.py :
  aforementioned pointing scraper script

get_go_session :
  a hacked version of get_go to get GO fits info from a particular session
  from a different archival source (used in the case where whole sessions
  didn't appear in the archives for some reason)

go_to_mysql :
  script to convert get_go logs into a bunch of sql statements for 
  insertion in the go_scans database
